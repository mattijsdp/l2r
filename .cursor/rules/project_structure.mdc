# Project Structure Standards

- **Modular Organization:** Organize code in a modular, maintainable structure.
- Follow these directory conventions:
  - `l2r/` - Main source code
  - `config/` - Hydra configuration files
  - `scripts/` - Utility and execution scripts
  - `tests/` - Test files
  - `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploration and visualization
  - `data/` - Data storage (or links to data)
  - `docs/` - Documentation

- Use meaningful file and directory names.
- Create a clear separation between model, data processing, and training code.
- Include a detailed README.md with setup and usage instructions.
- Document the paper being implemented with citation and key concepts.
- Follow a consistent naming convention for all files.
- Keep the repository clean of temporary files, checkpoints, etc. (use .gitignore).
