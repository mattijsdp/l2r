# Experiment Tracking and Logging Standards

- **MLflow:** All experiment tracking and model logging must use MLflow.
- Track experiments with appropriate names and tags to facilitate organization.
- Log all hyperparameters at the start of each run.
- Log metrics during training (loss, accuracy, etc.) at regular intervals.
- Log model artifacts (weights, optimizers, etc.) at checkpoints.
- Log visualizations (plots, confusion matrices, etc.).
- Add model descriptions and requirements for reproducibility.
- Create a consistent directory structure for experiment outputs.
- Use MLflow's autologging features where appropriate.

Example logging:
```python
import mlflow

# Start a run
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="experiment_name"):
    # Log parameters
    mlflow.log_params(config)
    
    # During training
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        # Training code
        # ...
        
        # Log metrics
        mlflow.log_metrics({
            "train_loss": train_loss,
            "val_loss": val_loss,
            "accuracy": accuracy
        }, step=epoch)
    
    # Log model
    mlflow.pytorch.log_model(model, "model")
```
