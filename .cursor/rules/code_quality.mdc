# Code Quality Standards

- **Ruff:** All Python code formatting and linting must use Ruff.
- Configure Ruff using the pyproject.toml file.
- Run linter and formatter checks before committing code.
- Use type annotations for all function and method signatures.
- Fix linting issues before opening merge requests.
